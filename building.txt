OVERVIEW
========
"Building" in this sense means recompiling the uImage kernel and the
initramfs that runs during boot, to set up LVM. If you're interested in
what comes after boot time, this is not the guide for you. Check out the
Arch Linux ARM PKGBUILD Github repository instead.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED
================
- A Linux Box (x86 or x86_64)
- Git
- Your distro's "uboot-mkimage" or "uboot-envtools" package installed
- CodeSourcery's Toolchain:
  https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release1294
- Moboot 0.3.4v or later installed on your TouchPad. Do not use ACME.
  
BUILDING
========
First, we'll install the CodeSourcery toolchain.
Second, we'll build the initramfs.
Third, we'll build the kernel.
Finally, we'll boot it.

INSTALL CODESOURCERY
====================
Download the "IA32 GNU/Linux Installer" here:
https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release1294
Chmod +x the file and run it. Install it, using defaults. It should be
placed into /home/youruser/CodeSourcery. Assuming it is, add the "bin"
folder to your PATH with:
export PATH=/home/youruser/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_G++_Lite/bin:$PATH
Test to see if it works by running "arm-none-eabi-ar". The command
should be found. If not, your PATH is wrong.

BUILDING THE INITRAMFS
