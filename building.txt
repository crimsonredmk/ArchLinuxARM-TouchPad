OVERVIEW
========
"Building" in this sense means recompiling the uImage kernel and the
initramfs that runs during boot, to set up LVM. If you're interested in
what comes after boot time, this is not the guide for you. Check out the
Arch Linux ARM PKGBUILD Github repository instead.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED
================
- A Linux Box (x86 or x86_64)
- Git
- Your distro's "uboot-mkimage" or "uboot-envtools" package installed
- CodeSourcery's Toolchain (link below)
- Moboot 0.3.4v or later installed on your TouchPad. Do not use ACME.
  
BUILDING
========
First, we'll install the CodeSourcery toolchain.
Second, we'll build the initramfs.
Third, we'll build the kernel.
Finally, we'll boot it.

INSTALL CODESOURCERY
====================
Download the "IA32 GNU/Linux Installer" here:
https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release1294

Chmod +x the file and run it. Install it, using defaults. It should be
placed into /home/youruser/CodeSourcery. Assuming it is, add the "bin"
folder to your PATH with:
export PATH=/home/youruser/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_G++_Lite/bin:$PATH

Test to see if it works by running "arm-none-eabi-ar". The command
should be found. If not, your PATH is wrong.

GET THE KERNEL SOURCE
=====================
This is the CyanogenMod kernel for Android at the moment.
git clone https://github.com/CyanogenMod/hp-kernel-tenderloin.git

BUILDING THE INITRAMFS
======================
"better-initramfs" is a simple way to build an initramfs to load LVM
and switch into Arch Linux ARM after LVM is all set up. See
better-initramfs/sourceroot/init for our init script. Everything in
sourceroot gets packed up into the initramfs.

To pack up an initramfs, run "make image" from inside the
better-initramfs directory. This will generate a "initramfs.cpio.gz".
Next, move the "initramfs.cpio.gz" file to your kernel directory,
"hp-kernel-tenderloin".

BUILDING THE KERNEL
===================
Run the following from within the "hp-kernel-tenderloin" directory:

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- clean
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- mrproper
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- tenderloin_android_defconfig
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- uImage -j5
mkimage -A arm -O linux -T ramdisk -C none -a 0x60000000 -e 0x60000000 -n "Image" -d ./initramfs.cpio.gz arch/arm/boot/uRamdisk
mkimage -A arm -O linux -T multi -a 0x40208000  -e  0x40208000 -C none -n "multi image" -d arch/arm/boot/uImage:arch/arm/boot/uRamdisk uImage.ArchLinuxARM

This will create a file named uImage.ArchLinuxARM. This is the file
you'll copy into your TouchPad's /boot/ directory.

That's all!
