This is a quick-start guide for people in a hurry who just want to run
Arch Linux ARM on their HP TouchPads.

If you're interested in building everything from the ground up, see
"building.txt".

QUICK START
===========

- You will need:
  A TouchPad
  A USB micro cable
  HP's webOS SDK installed (with novacom and novaterm)
  To read the whole guide before starting

- Install moboot 0.3.4v (0.3.5 is coming soon) on the TouchPad. Don't touch
or even think about using ACMEInstaller. Just do it by hand in novaterm.
Note that this guide was written with 0.3.4v and likely won't work on 0.3.4.

- Make an LVM partition for Arch Linux ARM. See "LVM.txt" for how.

- Mount the archlinuxarm partition somewhere and extract the armv5te rootfs
to it, not into a subfolder. Hint: /media/internal is the USB-mounted storage.

- Move uImage.ArchLinuxARM to /boot. You'll need to mount /boot rw first
though. You should also have uImage.moboot and uImage.webOS in there if
you've been following along.

- Reboot. Welcome to Arch Linux ARM on the HP TouchPad!
