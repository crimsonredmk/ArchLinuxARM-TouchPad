This is a quick-start guide for people in a hurry who just want to run
Arch Linux ARM on their HP TouchPads.

If you're interested in building everything from the ground up, see
"building.txt".

CREDITS
=======
- jcsullins and everyone from moboot
- jeanfrancisroy and Funtoo, for making LVM work!
- s7mx1 from XDA for this post: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1332629

QUICK START
===========

- You will need:
  A TouchPad
  A USB micro cable
  HP's webOS SDK installed (with novacom and novaterm)
  To read the whole guide before starting

- Install moboot 0.3.4v (0.3.5 is coming soon) on the TouchPad. Don't touch
or even think about using ACMEInstaller. Just do it by hand in novaterm.
Note that this guide was written with 0.3.4v and likely won't work on 0.3.4.

- Make an LVM partition for Arch Linux ARM. See "LVM.txt" for how.

- Mount the archlinuxarm partition somewhere and extract the armv5te rootfs
to it, not into a subfolder. Hint: /media/internal is the USB-mounted storage.

- Move uImage.ArchLinuxARM to /boot. You'll need to mount /boot rw first
though. You should also have uImage.moboot and uImage.webOS in there if
you've been following along.

- READ USAGE.TXT!!! You'll have to copy in stuff manually. This will all be
streamlined sooner or later.

- Reboot. Welcome to Arch Linux ARM on the HP TouchPad!

TODO
====
- Fix Xorg colors and fuzziness (CyanogenMod did it...)
- Enable touch input
- Fix V4L2 building in the kernel so the camera will work
- Replace "udev" with working "udev-oxnas" package
- Include wireless_tools in the default installation
- Include modpack.tar.gz in the default installation
- Fix ar6000.ko to work from the kernel sources, not from webOS
- Write a bash script to do all of it from webOS

FAQ
===
- What does uImage.ArchLinuxARM do?
+ uImage.ArchLinuxARM is a kernel and minimal environment to boot Arch Linux ARM.
+ When moboot 0.3.5 is released, we will most likely have to rebuild this.

- How do I interact with the TouchPad?
+ A USB OTG *host* adapter and a *powered* USB hub, with a keyboard. Amazon has one here:
+ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GGBYJ4/
+ EDIT: Looks like you'll need this item too. It's significance is explained in the
+ "usage.txt" file: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JIOHDE/

- How do I reboot the TouchPad?
+ Hold the top button and center button for about 15 seconds.

- Nothing works!
+ We know, this is an alpha developer preview. Hopefully others can help us out!
