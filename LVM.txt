Running this in novaterm while booted into webOS will resize your media space and create a partition
for Arch Linux ARM that is 2048MB. This can really be any size larger than 1GB. Run each line individually.

lvm.static lvresize -L -2048M /dev/store/media
lvm.static lvcreate -L 2048M -n root-arch store
