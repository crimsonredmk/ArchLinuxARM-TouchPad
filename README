This is a quick-start guide for people in a hurry who just want to run
Arch Linux ARM on their HP TouchPads.

If you're interested in building everything from the ground up, see
"building.txt".

QUICK START
===========

- You will need:
  A TouchPad
  A USB micro cable
  HP's webOS SDK installed (with novacom and novaterm)
  To read the whole guide before starting

- Install moboot 0.3.5 on the TouchPad. Don't use ACMEInstaller. Just do it by hand in novaterm.

- Make an LVM partition for Arch Linux ARM. See "LVM.txt" for how.

- Mount the arch-root partition somewhere and extract the rootfs to it, 
not into a subfolder.

- Move uImage.ArchLinuxARM to /boot. You'll need to mount /boot rw first
though. You should also have uImage.moboot and uImage.webOS in there if
you've been following along.

- READ USAGE.TXT!!! You'll have to copy in stuff manually. This will all be
streamlined sooner or later.

- Reboot. Welcome to Arch Linux ARM on the HP TouchPad!

TODO
====
- Fix V4L2 building in the kernel so the camera will work
- Fix wicd to recognize eth0 as WiFi

FAQ
===
- What does uImage.ArchLinuxARM do?
+ uImage.ArchLinuxARM is a kernel and minimal environment to boot Arch Linux ARM, compatible with moboot 0.3.5 and up.

- How do I interact with the TouchPad?
+ See "usage.txt".

- How do I force reboot the TouchPad?
+ Hold the top button and center button for about 15 seconds, or use the usual "reboot" command.

- Nothing works!
+ We know, this is an alpha developer preview. Hopefully others can help us out!

- How do I remove Arch Linux ARM/Android/CyanogenMod?
+ Back on webOS, run the command "lvm" from novaterm. From there, the command "lvs"
+ show you your logical volumes. Delete any you don't want, e.g. archlinuxarm or cm-data, etc.
+ by running lvremove store/name-of-volume. Then, resize your media partition with
+ lvresize -L +90000M store/media (this will make "media" as big as possible).
